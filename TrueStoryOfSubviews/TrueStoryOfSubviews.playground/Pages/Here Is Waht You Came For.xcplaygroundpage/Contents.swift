 # True Story
 
 This is something that happened to me at work. During a code review I have stumbled upon a piece of code that looked something like this:
 */


extension UIView {
    func originalAllSubViewsOf<T: UIView>(type: T.Type) -> [T] {
        var all = [T]()
        func getSubview(view: UIView) {
            if let aView = view as? T { all.append(aView) }
            guard view.subviews.isEmpty == false else { return }
            view.subviews.forEach { getSubview(view: $0) }
        }
        getSubview(view: self)
        return all
    }
}

 And I have left a comment `could it be done with a filter?`.
 
 ## Context
 
 If you have done any UIKit work then you will recognise this method in an instance! The need is obvious.
 
 If this is new for you then in a deep view hierarchy of a view controller you have some custom views (or not necessary custom). And you want to call a method on each of them no matter how deep the rabbit hole goes.
 
 Sure you can use `subviews` but what happens when those views also have subviews and you need to get to them too? This extension is an answer to that.
 
 Let's see how it works. We need some views and subviews and classes... lets do this ;)
 */

class A: UIView {}
class B: UIView {}

let viewHierarchy: B = {
    let view = B()
    
    view
        .addSubview({
            let subview = UIView()
                subview
                    .addSubview(A())
            return subview
            }())
    
    view
        .addSubview(UILabel())
    
    view
        .addSubview({
            let subview = UIView()
            
            subview
                .addSubview(UILabel())
            
            subview
                .addSubview(A())
            
            subview
                .addSubview({
                    let subSubView = A()
                    
                    subSubView
                        .addSubview(B())
                    
                    return subSubView
                }())
            
            return subview
            }())
    
    return view
}()

/*:
 To summarise this hierarchy has:
 * 3 instances of UIView-a -- there is a catch as *all* of them are UIViews ;)
 * 2 instances of UILabel-s

 Ok so now we can take this extension and take it for a spin. We won't do anything with those instances only pluck out them from this hierarchy.

let allAs = viewHierarchy.originalAllSubViewsOf(type: A.self)

/*:
 As you can see this kind of method can be very handy. Especially if you want to do something to only one kind of views that are visible on screen.
 
 What's cooler that this is strongly typed. Each time we are getting an array of the views that we are interested in. No need to cast no nothing. Good, cool API to use... but ;)
 
 Lets take a look at the implementation one more time:
 
````
 func originalAllSubViewsOf<T: UIView>(type: T.Type) -> [T] {
     var all = [T]()
     func getSubview(view: UIView) {
         if let aView = view as? T { all.append(aView) }
         guard view.subviews.isEmpty == false else { return }
         view.subviews.forEach { getSubview(view: $0) }
     }
     getSubview(view: self)
     return all
 }
````
 
It's function with a nested function that calls itself recursively. There is a check if the current view also fits the predicate and should be added to an `all` accumulator array. What's a bit messy is that mutation of this array is done by the inner function... but the whole thing is internal to the implementation so... like you see. There are a lot of tradeoffs here. The name of the function conveys more of the intent of the developer than the implementation.
 
 ## Can we do better?
 
Define better. For now I will say better is _less code_ and reuse Swift higher-order functions. So after some time of fiddling around, I have come up with this:
 */

extension UIView {
    func views<T>(of type: T.Type) -> [T] {
        subviews
            .reduce(
                (self as? T).map{ [$0] } ?? [],
                { (acc, subview) in acc + subview.views(of: type) }
        )
    }
}

/*:
 You must admit that implementation did reduced quite a bit ;) Thing to notice is how the initial element for the reduce function is computed: `(self as? T).map{ [$0] } ?? []`. In my _private_ code I have some helper functions and operators to make it more streamlined but... I think it is still very dense and conveys meaning very well.
 
 Next is the **partial result block**. And I must say I like it a lot. It says _give me what you have so far and add to it result of getting views(of:)_.
 
 This is dense. So lets see how it goes against original implementation:
 */

run("🌟 reduced implementation") {
    print("Test allAs have the same count:",
          assertEqual(
            allAs.count,
            viewHierarchy.views(of: A.self).count
        )
    )
    
    print("Test allBs have the same count:",
          assertEqual(
            allBs.count,
            viewHierarchy.views(of: B.self).count
        )
    )
    
    print("Test allLs have the same count:",
          assertEqual(
            allLs.count,
            viewHierarchy.views(of: UILabel.self).count
        )
    )
    
    print("Test allVs have the same count:",
          assertEqual(
            allVs.count,

/*:
 Sweet! As far our tests go we have the same behaviour. But...
 
 ## Can we do better?
  
 Define better. There are more relationships like this in UIKit and who knows where else. Let's take **UIViewController** for a spin. You can add a **child view controller** to it.

 As you can see this is the same shape. As a bonus because there is no information about any of the types we cannot mutate anything! But let's take it pice by pice.
 
 The first argument is the _Type_ we are interested in. Second is the instance this function will start this working. And this function needs to know how to extract some stuff from thing we are currently working on. To put it in context of previous examples how to get subviews from a view and children from ViewController.

 You can say that the most interesting stuff is the `extractStuff` part. And it is! That's the part when you inject the behavior of getting substuff! And you can lift a [KeyPath to a function](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0249-key-path-literal-function-expressions.md) so everything is statically checked!

# Conclusion
 
 Let's get back to this PR and the comment. Developer stayed with his original implementation and that is fine. This is just code ;)
 
 More important is that part when we went that extra mile. Finding and defining this function as this give us a nice chance to talk about it. See what is possible and when to say stop, it's enough. For him it was that original implementation. For me I would go with `reduce` version and copied it to other places where it was needed.
 
 Why copy? It's easier to understand. Closer to the task at hand. So wat it's copied? :)
 
 Thanks for reading this :)
